#### A Google Sheets add on to help students with basic financial accounting




### Plan
- App will be driven by prompts
- User selects from a series of functions (ADA, ratios, etc...)
- User enters the necessary info
- App generates a section on the spreadsheet and gives an answer
  - First column reserved for entered variables
- As user tries more functions, the variables are maintained so they don't have to be reentered


### Example Story
- User creates new spreadsheet
- User clicks "Half Blood" (HB)
- Prompt asks user what he needs
- User selects "Altman Z-Score"
- User enters necessary values
  - Working capital
  - Total Assets
  - Retained Earnings
  - EBIT
  - Market Value Of Equity
  - Total Liabilities
  - Sales
- HB saves the variables and puts them onto spreadsheet
- HB Calculates Z-Score and puts it on the spreadsheet
  - Maybe adds a small description that says what that number means

- User clicks HB
- User selects "Times Interest Earned"
- User enters values
  - EBIT has already been entered
  - Interest Expense
- HB saves the variables and puts them onto spreadsheet
- HB Calculates Times interest earned and puts it on the spreadsheet

- etc...
